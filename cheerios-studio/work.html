                <em>Color Palette: </em>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The chosen color palette consists of four colors: 
                    primary, secondary, accent 1, and accent 2.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The primary color (#396E94) is a deep blue tone that 
                    evokes a sense of depth and stability, which can be suitable for a 
                    water-related adventure theme.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The secondary color (#A43312) is a warm reddish-brown shade that adds contrast and 
                    energy to the palette.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The accent 1 color (#DD6031) is a vibrant orange hue that can create a 
                    focal point and draw attention to specific elements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The accent 2 color (#FFFFFF) is white, which provides a clean and neutral 
                    background for the content.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Overall, the chosen color palette offers a harmonious combination of colors 
                that can evoke a sense of adventure and energy, while also maintaining visual balance 
                and readability.
                <hr>
                <em>Typography:</em>
                The chosen heading font, "Inter," is a versatile and modern sans-serif typeface. 
                It is known for its legibility and suitability for various design contexts.
                The paragraph font, "Montserrat," is another popular sans-serif typeface that offers a 
                clean and elegant appearance. It is widely used for both headings and body text.
                The selected typography was a good choice, as both "Inter" and "Montserrat" are widely 
                recognized and commonly used fonts that offer readability and a contemporary aesthetic.
                Overall, the chosen color palette and typography is well-suited for a whitewater rafting 
                and adventure-themed website. The colors convey a sense of excitement and nature, while the 
                typography ensures clear and legible text throughout the website.
