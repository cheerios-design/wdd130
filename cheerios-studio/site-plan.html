        <br>
        <em>Color Palette:</em><br>
        The chosen color palette consists of four colors: primary, secondary, accent 1, and accent 2.
        The primary color (#396E94) is a deep blue tone that evokes a sense of depth and stability, 
        which can be suitable for a water-related adventure theme.
        The secondary color (#A43312) is a warm reddish-brown shade that adds 
        contrast and energy to the palette.
        The accent 1 color (#DD6031) is a vibrant orange hue that can 
        create a focal point and draw attention to specific elements.
        The accent 2 color (#FFFFFF) is white, which provides a clean and neutral 
        background for the content.
        Overall, the chosen color palette offers a harmonious combination of colors 
        that can evoke a sense of adventure and energy, 
        while also maintaining visual balance and readability.
        <em>Typography:</em><br>
        The chosen heading font, "Inter," is a versatile and modern sans-serif typeface. 
        It is known for its legibility and suitability for various design contexts.
        The paragraph font, "Montserrat," is another popular sans-serif typeface that 
        offers a clean and elegant appearance. It is widely used for both headings and body text.
        The selected typography was a good choice, as both "Inter" and "Montserrat" 
        are widely recognized and commonly used fonts that offer readability and a 
        contemporary aesthetic.
        Overall, the chosen color palette and typography is well-suited for a 
        whitewater rafting and adventure-themed website. 
        The colors convey a sense of excitement and nature, 
        while the typography ensures clear and legible text throughout the website.
