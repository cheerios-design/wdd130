            <p>
                Hello everyone! Allow me to introduce myself. My name is <em>Sam Daramroei</em>
                I am 22 years old. I am originally Iranian but currently I live in Turkey.<br>
                I have been a member of this awesome Church since 2016 and I am currently serving as
                <em>Young Adult Area Advisory - Central Eurosian Mission (Turkey Representitive)</em>,
                <em>Stake Committee Lead</em>, <em>Rising Generation - Comms Team</em> and a <em>Branch Missionary</em>.
                I am absolutely loving it even thogh sometimes I have to sit down hours in pure confusion not knowing what has
                the priority.

            <p>
                I am a fresh freelancer in UI/UX and Graphic Design, Video Editing, Translation and Interpretation.
                But really need and want to step up and pursue programming so I can showcase my skills and talents.
                I play Volleyball and my position is <em>Libero</em> (yes, I am short! 5.61024 foot tall.)
                I am mostly planinng to be a <em>Data Scientist</em> and be a Full-Stack Developer too.<br>
                Outside this course I am taking <em>Android App Development</em>, <em>Full-Stack Web Development</em>
                and <em>Data Science</em> courses. (yes, I may have gotten way too excited..)
            </p>
            <p>
